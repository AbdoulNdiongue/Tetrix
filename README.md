# Tetrix
Tetrix is the traditional tetris game with a few interesting twists. 

This game was programmed using functions from a CMU utility package, which must be installed for it to work.

Download the python file (install-cmu-graphics.py), which is in the repository, and run it with Python 3.11 (or 3.10, but very preferably 3.11) in VS Code in order to install cmu_112_graphics. You should see the message "Success: cmu-graphics is installed" (potentially below some other information) in your terminal if everything worked correctly.
